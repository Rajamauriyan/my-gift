<div> happy birhtday inika </div>
      <p>It all began in the 8th grade. I still remember the first time I saw you—you walked into the classroom, and I couldn’t take my eyes off you. Your smile was like sunshine, lighting up the room and my heart.</p>
      <p>As we became friends, I realized how amazing you are—kind, funny, and full of life. You made every day brighter, and I found myself looking forward to seeing you more and more.</p>
      <p>Then came the moment I realized it wasn’t just a crush anymore. You became my everything. Your laughter, your voice, your love for nature—it all captivated me. I knew I had fallen for you, deeply and completely.</p>
      <p>Now, here I am, pouring my heart out to you. I know we are different—you, radiant as the moon, and I, dark as the midnight sky. But isn’t it in the embrace of night and day that the most beautiful sunrises are born?</p>

      <h2>My Dearest Inika,</h2>
      <div class="letter-content">
        <p>I don’t know how to weave words as beautifully as the stars paint the night, but I do know this—every beat of my heart whispers your name. You are the dawn to my dusk, the light that makes my world glow even when I stand in shadows.</p>
        <p>I know we are different—you, radiant as the moon, and I, dark as the midnight sky. But isn’t it in the embrace of night and day that the most beautiful sunrises are born? Love isn’t about shades; it’s about souls. And my soul has found its home in you.</p>
        <p>Maybe you don’t feel the same, maybe this love will remain a whisper in the wind, but I want you to know—no matter what, you will always be the most beautiful part of my story. If love were a color, it wouldn’t be black or white; it would be the shade of every heartbeat we share.</p>

      <p>Inika, your name, a melody so sweet,<br>A whisper of love where my heartbeats meet.<br>Like moonlight dancing upon the sea,<br>You shine so bright, you're all I see.</p>
      <p>Your eyes, like galaxies, endless and deep,<br>A universe where my wishes sleep.<br>Your smile—sunrise on a golden shore,<br>With every glance, I love you more.</p>
      <p>The wind may wander, the seasons change,<br>But my love for you will never wane.<br>For in your presence, time stands still,<br>A love so pure, a heart so filled.</p>
      <p>So take my hand, let's chase the skies,<br>Write our love in stardust lines.<br>Forever, Inika, just you and me,<br>A love as vast as the endless sea.</p>
